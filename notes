Deep Generative Models
- what are Deterministic Generative Models
- distributions: multivariate normal vs multi-modal, asymmetric
- Change of Variables: Example: watch Video and think about intuition
- Change of Variable Formula, deriviation of single number?
- Jacobian?
- go through Change of Variable Formula: Log Version for stacking
- universality theorem?
- Forward and Reverse Parametrization?
- different flows: Planar/Radial flows, RealNVP, IAF, MAF (Autoregressive Flows), Spline
- how are NF used in conjunction with eg NN?
- write down formulas and contrast forward vs reverse
- look for reverse parametrization examples of functions
- Jacobian Determinant Computation
- Jacobian: diagonal, triangular, full
